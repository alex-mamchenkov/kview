You are continuing development of the project "kview".

Project summary:
- Local, single-binary Kubernetes UI
- Go backend + embedded React/MUI frontend
- View-first, RBAC-aware
- Strict UI/UX contract (docs/UI_UX_GUIDE.md)
- AI execution rules (docs/AI_AGENT_RULES.md)
- Milestones defined in README.md

Milestone 1 — Full UI Overview is complete.

Next active milestone:
Milestone 2 — Full Resource Control.

Development constraints:
- No new dependencies unless explicitly approved
- Always enforce cross-links
- Always enforce title-above-value layout
- Always run `make build` before proposing documentation updates or commit messages
- No auto-commits

Start by:
1) Confirming understanding
2) Proposing a structured implementation plan for Milestone 2
3) Breaking it into iterative packs
